1. Multi-tasking is the ability of an operating system to allow multiple programs or processes  run at the same time. E.g Using Photoshop and MS Word application at the same time.

2. While multitasking allows more than one program/ processes run concurrently, multi-threading is the ability of a single program to run individual sub processes or threads (the smallest unit of operation that can be performed in an OS) at the same time. E.g watching a video and downloading it at the same time.

3. Anonymous functions are functions that do not have names.. They are created using the function operator and are declared at runtime (unlike functions created with function declarations that are hoisted).

4. An asynchronous function is a function that accepts a callback function as parameter which is called after the completion of a task, 

5. A web worker is a javascript script that can run background operations (usually CPU intensive operations) on a seperate thread different from the main execution thread of a web application.The worker instantiates a separate message queue, event loop, and memory space independent from the original thread This prevents the main thread (usually the UI) thread from being blocked or slowed.
